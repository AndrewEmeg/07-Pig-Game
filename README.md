This project is one of the many projects in my current JavaScript course on Udemy as at May 14, 2024. I built this project by observing my instructor and implementing my observations in my code, sometimes in a different way. The HTML and CSS were given to me as starter files, since it was a JavaScript course.

Hey everyone! 🌟<br>

I've got another cool project to share from my JavaScript course: the 'Pig Game'! 🎲🐷<br>

Not familiar with it? Let me give you a quick rundown:<br>

## **INSTRUCTIONS:**<br>
✅ The game of Pig is a super simple but thrilling dice game where two players race to reach 100 points. 🎯<br>
✅ On each turn, a player rolls a die repeatedly until either they roll a 1 or they decide to hold and score the sum of their rolls (the turn total). It's edge-of-your-seat exciting every time! 😬<br>

## **Here’s the deal:**<br>
🎲 **Roll the die:**<br>
1️⃣ Roll a 1: Your turn ends, and you score nothing. It’s your opponent's turn now. 😞<br>
2️⃣ Roll a 2-6: The number is added to your turn total, and you can keep rolling. 🎉<br>
🛑 **Hold:** Add your turn total to your score and let your opponent take their shot. 🏆<br>

You can play with a friend or just play solo, imagining yourself as two players. 😆<br>

Curious to see how it works? Dive into the fun and give it a go on [Netlify]([https://lnkd.in/g-Wd_tCc](https://andrew-emeghebo-pig-game.netlify.app/))<br>

Enjoy the game and let me know how you do! 🚀💯<br>

Happy rolling! 🎲<br>
