This project is one of the many projects in my current JavaScript course on Udemy as at May 14, 2024. I built this project by observing my instructor and implementing my observations in my code, sometimes in a different way. The HTML and CSS were given to me as starter files, since it was a JavaScript course.

Hey everyone! 🌟

I've got another cool project to share from my JavaScript course: the 'Pig Game'! 🎲🐷

Not familiar with it? Let me give you a quick rundown:

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
✅ The game of Pig is a super simple but thrilling dice game where two players race to reach 100 points. 🎯
✅ On each turn, a player rolls a die repeatedly until either they roll a 1 or they decide to hold and score the sum of their rolls (the turn total). It's edge-of-your-seat exciting every time! 😬

**Here’s the deal:**
🎲 **Roll the die:**
1️⃣ Roll a 1: Your turn ends, and you score nothing. It’s your opponent's turn now. 😞
2️⃣ Roll a 2-6: The number is added to your turn total, and you can keep rolling. 🎉
🛑 **Hold:** Add your turn total to your score and let your opponent take their shot. 🏆

You can play with a friend or just play solo, imagining yourself as two players. 😆

Happy rolling! 🎲
